# Hi, I'm Abdulrehman

**Data Science Student · Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer · Python Developer**

I work on practical Python, data analysis, and machine learning projects with a strong focus on logic, clarity, and real-world use cases. My goal is to build a solid foundation in Data Science and gradually move toward production-level ML systems.

## What I Work On
- Data analysis using Python
- Machine learning models for classification and prediction
- Beginner to intermediate Python projects focused on logic building
- Academic and self-driven AI projects

---

## Learning Focus
- Python fundamentals and clean coding practices
- Data analysis with NumPy and Pandas
- Machine learning with scikit-learn
- Neural networks and deep learning fundamentals (ANN → CNN)
- Applying ML concepts to small real-world problems
